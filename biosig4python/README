    biosig4python supports reading various biosignal dataformats into Python.
    The data is converted first into a simplified GDF (same simple data type
    and same sampling rate for all channels) using biosig2gdf, and
    the output is than processed and parsed by loadgdf.py().
    The advantage of this approach over the python extension module is, that
    it works on any platform (including MS Windows); the disadvantages is
    it needs twice as much memory and an extra data copying step is needed.
