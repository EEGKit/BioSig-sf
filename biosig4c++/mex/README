This provides a language binding of libbiosig to Matlab and Octave. 
Basically, mex-files for loading biosig data are provided.
- mexSLOAD.mex* loads the whole file (header and data). 
- mexSOPEN.mex* reads only the header information. 
- mexSSAVE.mex* saves data into various biosig format 
   the list of supported formats is shown here: http://pub.ist.ac.at/~schloegl/biosig/TESTED


COMPILATION: 

== Octave on Linux =======================
On Linux platforms the compilation is straight forward. A prerequisite is
libbiosig (with its dependencies).
     make libbiosig && sudo make install

Generate and install mexbiosig-package
     make mexbiosig
     sudo make install_mexbiosig

== Octave on MacOSX =======================
You need to have homebrew  (for details see http://brew.sh)
   ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

and install biosig
   brew tap schloegl/biosig
   brew install mexbiosig

== Octave/MXE on Windows/Cygwin =======================
   not tested yet


== Matlab on Linux, MacOSX  =======================
Prerequisites:
    sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev libsuitesparse-dev
Edit Makefile and set the correct path to Matlab:
The mex files for Matlab are generated with 
	MATLABDIR=/usr/local/MATLAB/R2014b make mex4m


== Matlab v7.11 for Win32 ================
Compilation was successful using the mingw-cross-env on linux to generate Win32/mex files. 
GnuMex/Mingw must be installed together with Matlab on windows.
The gnumex libraries must be copied to the linux machine having MinGW-Cross-env installed. 
Adapt the Makefile and run 
	make mexw32 mexw64
