This provides a language binding of libbiosig to Matlab and Octave. 
Basically, mex-files for loading biosig data are provided.
- mexSLOAD.mex* loads the whole file (header and data). 
- mexSOPEN.mex* reads only the header information. 
- mexSSAVE.mex* saves data into various biosig format 
   the list of supported formats is shown here: http://pub.ist.ac.at/~schloegl/biosig/TESTED


COMPILATION: 

== Octave on Linux =======================
On Linux platforms the compilation is straight forward. The prerequisites are 
    sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev libsuitesparse-dev liboctave-dev
Octave version < 3.8.0 requrire octave-headers instead of liboctave-dev
The mex files for Octave are generated with 
	make mex4o 


== Matlab on Linux =======================
Prerequisites:
    sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev libsuitesparse-dev
Edit Makefile and set the correct path to Matlab:
The mex files for Matlab are generated with 
	make mex4m


== Matlab v7.11 for Win32 ================
Compilation was successful using the mingw-cross-env on linux to generate Win32/mex files. 
GnuMex/Mingw must be installed together with Matlab on windows.
The gnumex libraries must be copied to the linux machine having MinGW-Cross-env installed. 
Adapt the Makefile and run 
	make mexw32 mexw64
