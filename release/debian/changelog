biosig4c++ (1.6.1-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * debian/control:
       switch to dh-python2
       boosted policy compliance to 3.9.5

  * support for additional data formats
       ABF1, AXG
  * support improved for
       CFS (performance, scaling), SCP (convert strings to UTF-8),
       ISHNE, HEKA (TimeStamps, performance), MFER, IGOR
  * bug fixes in supported data formats:
       EDF+, ITX, HEKA (scaling), CFS

  * JSON output format for header added.

  * ABI changed:
    The size of some structs, and some enumeration types have changed.
    Most likely, You'll need to recompile your application, even if
    the dynamic biosig library (.so, .dll) is used.

  * API change: field CHANNEL->PhysDim is removed.
     This is already deprecated for quite a while.
     Use instead the function PhysDim3(CHANNEL->PhysDimCode)
